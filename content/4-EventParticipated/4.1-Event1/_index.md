### Sharing from Mr. Nguyễn Gia Hưng – Head of Solutions Architect, AWS Vietnam

Mr. Hưng opened the event by sharing the story of AWS entering the Vietnamese market in 2015, key customers who are using AWS, and the increasing demand for cloud adoption among enterprises in Vietnam.  
He emphasized that there are **huge career opportunities** in the tech industry, especially in Cloud, DevOps, and AI/ML.

What impressed me the most was his **learning mindset**:

- Learning technology requires **serious investment**
- Don’t just watch tutorials — **practice many times**
- When hearing something new, **don’t be afraid** — research deeply before asking
- **Be kind** and contribute to the community
- Learning is a **long-term, continuous journey**

He stressed that in order to truly understand a new skill, we need to **build real projects**, practice repeatedly, and try to **teach it to others**.  
I realized that I made the mistake of only watching videos without enough practice — something I need to change immediately.

He encouraged students to take OJT **seriously**, not only for the internship confirmation, but to truly learn, connect, and take advantage of every opportunity FCJ brings.

### Sharing from Mr. Đỗ Huy Thắng — DevOps Lead, VNG

Mr. Thắng brought a practical perspective about the DevOps field in Vietnam:  
DevOps is not just tools — it is about **ownership and responsibility for running systems**.

Some key lessons I noted:

- DevOps means being **ready anytime** when the system alerts
- Don’t let “6 years of experience = 1 year repeated 6 times”
- Experience is built through **real troubleshooting**
- DevOps requires **discipline, responsibility, and continuous learning**

When discussing salary expectations, Mr. Hưng also highlighted that **high salary comes with pressure and continuous learning requirements** — which helped me understand the reality behind the role.

Mr. Nghị shared his journey from FCJ to becoming a GenAI Engineer, along with the projects he worked on, including **a project assigned by the Chairman of Ho Chi Minh City at the Walking Street**.  
I truly admired his **determination and continuous efforts** in learning, preparing for interviews, and building his career. His story showed that starting point does not matter as much as **persistence and dedication**.

### Sharing from Ms. Bùi Hồ Linh Nhi — AI Engineer, SoftwareOne (FCJ Alumni)

Ms. Nhi, an alumna of FPT University (K16), shared her learning journey with FCJ and her experiences working in the AI industry.  
She was very **friendly and supportive**, sharing tips on preparing CVs, interview experiences, choosing the right work environment, and her journey from student to AI engineer. Her sharing helped me understand the **career development pathway** in this domain.

### Sharing from Mr. Phạm Nguyễn Hải Anh — Cloud Engineer, G-Asia Pacific

Mr. Hải Anh shared his inspiring story of joining FCJ while **serving in the military**, overcoming difficulties and leveraging support from the FCJ community.

**there is no barrier if we are determined to learn and grow**.
