## Event: AI-Driven Development Life Cycle — Reimagining Software Engineering

The rise of Generative AI is creating a strategic shift in how software is designed, built, deployed, and maintained. Instead of treating AI as a support tool, modern organizations are integrating AI directly into the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** — from architecture design, development, testing, deployment, security, to operations.

By applying AI to SDLC, engineering teams can automate **undifferentiated heavy lifting** tasks: boilerplate code generation, test case creation, technical documentation, environment setup, architectural patterns, and even security recommendations. This automation increases development speed, reduces repetitive work, and enables developers to focus on **creative, high-value engineering activities**.

This workshop introduces the concept of the **AI-Driven Development Life Cycle**, along with live demonstrations of **Amazon Q Developer** and **Kiro**, showing how AI can accelerate development workflows, improve product quality, and support secure, scalable software architecture.
