Application Load Balancer (ALB) is far more than a simple traffic distributor. It serves as the intelligent and secure front door for modern applications, playing a critical role in architecting for scalability, resilience, and performance. While setting up a basic load balancer is straightforward, unlocking its full potential requires a deeper understanding of its advanced capabilities.

This lab is designed to bridge that gap. We will move beyond the fundamentals and dive into the powerful features that allow you to build sophisticated, efficient, and operationally excellent application environments. You will learn how to route traffic with surgical precision, support modern communication protocols, and fine-tune your configuration for optimal health and performance.

By the end of this lab, you will not just understand these features in theory, but you will have practically implemented them in a realistic environment.

### Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this lab, you will be able to:

<<<<<<< HEAD
- Implement sophisticated content-based routing rules using host headers and URL paths to direct traffic to different microservices.
- Enable and test modern protocols like HTTP/2 and WebSockets to enhance application performance and enable real-time communication.
- Configure sticky sessions to correctly handle stateful application requirements.
- Tune health check parameters for faster failover detection and increased application resilience.
- Set up robust monitoring, logging, and alarms using Amazon CloudWatch to gain operational visibility into your application's traffic and health.
- Analyze the cost implications of different ALB configurations and troubleshoot common issues effectively.
=======
