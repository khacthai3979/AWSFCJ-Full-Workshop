During my internship at **Amazon Web Services Vietnam LLC** from **September 08, 2025** to **December 24, 2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge gained from university in a real-world working environment at one of the world’s leading technology companies.

I participated in the development of the **NutriChat intelligent nutrition assistant application**, deployed using a **Cloud-Native** model on AWS infrastructure. In this project, I was directly involved in system architecture design, infrastructure deployment with Terraform, backend API development using Django, frontend development with Vue.js, integrating Amazon Cognito for user authentication, connecting PostgreSQL database on Amazon RDS, deploying containers to Amazon ECS Fargate, and integrating the **Claude 3 Haiku** AI model through Amazon Bedrock.

Throughout the internship, I strengthened my professional knowledge in:

- Modern Web Application Development (Vue.js, Django REST Framework)
- AWS Well-Architected Framework best practices
- Infrastructure as Code using Terraform
- Containerization with Docker & ECS
- Identity & Access Management (IAM, Cognito)
- Databases on AWS RDS and data security
- Monitoring & Logging using CloudWatch
- Microservices architecture and DevOps mindset
- Applying AI to real-world applications

In terms of working behavior and attitude, I proactively studied documentation, discussed with mentors and colleagues when facing technical issues, and ensured all assigned tasks were completed on time and within scope.

To objectively reflect on my internship process, I would like to provide the following self-assessment:
