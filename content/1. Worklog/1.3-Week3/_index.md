### **Week 3 Achievements**

In week 3, practical tasks focused on database deployment, auto scaling and system monitoring were completed. Achievements include:

#### 1. Practice deploying databases with Amazon RDS

* Successfully create RDS Instance (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
* Configure RDS Subnet Group and Security Group
* Connect RDS from EC2 Instance and Cloud9
* Practice backing up database and restoring from snapshot
* Learn main RDS features:
  * Multi-AZ Deployment
  * Automated Backups
  * Performance Insights
  * Parameter Group

#### 2. Consolidate basic CCNA knowledge

* Continue learning:
  * Subnetting and VLSM
  * Static Routing and Dynamic Routing (OSPF/RIP)
  * LAN vs WAN
  * Routing Table and how it works
* Better understand the role of networking in cloud

#### 3. Auto-scale applications with Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling

* Create Auto Scaling Group (ASG) with Launch Template
* Configure Scaling Policy based on CPU Utilization
* Practice automatic scale-out and scale-in
* Understand scaling flow:
  * Trigger → Launch new instance → Register with Load Balancer

#### 4. Monitor systems with Amazon CloudWatch

* Create Dashboard monitoring:
  * CPU Utilization
  * Network In/Out
  * Memory usage (on Agent)
* Set up CloudWatch Alarms when CPU exceeds threshold
* Understand logging mechanism:
  * CloudWatch Logs
  * Metric Filters

#### 5. Learn and discuss directly on campus

* Discuss relevant knowledge with mentors
* Receive feedback on learning methods and roadmap
* Share practical experience with classmates
* Focus on consolidating networking and cloud knowledge
