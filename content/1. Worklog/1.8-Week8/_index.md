### **Week 8 Achievements**

* Successfully executed `terraform apply` to automatically create resources (S3 Bucket) on AWS.
* Mastered parameterizing Terraform configurations using **variables** (declared in `.tf` files) and managing values centrally in a **`.tfvars`** file.
* Gained a clear understanding of CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) concepts and benefits.
* Successfully built a basic CI/CD pipeline using **AWS CodePipeline**, automating the process from source (CodeCommit) to deployment.
* Successfully integrated an automated testing stage into the pipeline using **AWS CodeBuild**.
* Mastered and practiced automated application deployment to EC2 using **AWS CodeDeploy**, including debugging deployment scripts.
* Finished the week with a strong foundation in both Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation, Terraform) and DevOps principles (CI/CD with AWS tools).
