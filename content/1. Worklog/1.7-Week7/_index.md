### **Week 7 Achievements**

Week 7 marks the important phase transitioning from AWS service practice to personal project planning. Achievements include:

#### 1. Campus learning activities

* Participate in learning sessions and direct discussions
* Receive feedback from instructors about learning direction
* Discuss cloud solutions and real-world applications with classmates

#### 2. Define personal project direction

* Determine **project being implemented** and **project purpose**
* Analyze **problems to solve** and why project is meaningful
* Define **target users** and real-world needs
* Sketch initial project idea and core value of solution

#### 3. Research and consult with mentor

* Receive mentor feedback on:
  * Technical perspective (Architecture, Cloud)
  * Implementation feasibility and scope
  * Appropriateness within project building timeframe
  * Cost optimization
* Adjust project direction according to advice

#### 4. Practice network connection with VPC Peering

* Create 2 independent VPCs
* Configure VPC Peering and routes between subnets
* Check cross-network connectivity (ping, SSH, database)
* Understand VPC Peering use cases:
  * Connect between Dev/Prod environments
  * Connect multiple microservices
  * Cross-account connection

#### 5. Self-learn & expand knowledge

* Understand application architectures:
  * Serverless Architecture
  * Microservices on AWS
  * AI/ML integration
* Research how to design architecture suitable for chosen project
* Review VPC, IAM, S3, EC2 knowledge for system design
