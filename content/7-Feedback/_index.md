# Evaluation of the First Cloud Journey (FCJ) Internship Program

## 1. Overview of My Experience
After completing the First Cloud Journey (FCJ) internship, I realized that this is not just a typical internship but a **well-designed learning journey** where I was exposed to real-world cloud-native practices, DevOps culture, and modern software delivery methods.

What impressed me most was the learning model at FCJ. It is not about passive training, but about **learning together, building together, and sharing experience**, which helped me accelerate my understanding of Cloud and DevOps fundamentals in a practical way.

---

## 2. FCJ Training Model
The FCJ program follows a modern and structured learning approach that reflects how cloud engineers work in real environments:

- **Clear learning milestones** with goals and deadlines  
- **High-quality AWS materials** for self-learning  
- **1:1 mentoring** for technical guidance  
- **Deep-dive workshops** led by AWS experts  
- **Hands-on projects** based on realistic use cases  
- **Review & Retrospective** after each sprint  

This approach helped me develop a **problem-solving mindset**, rather than relying on shortcuts or ready answers.

---

## 3. Support from Mentor and Admin
Throughout the internship, my mentor spent time guiding me through complex topics, listening to my challenges, and suggesting good practices for investigation and troubleshooting.  
I learned how to:

- ask the right questions  
- keep track of the troubleshooting process  
- read official documentation rather than searching for shortcuts  

The program admin team was also very supportive — providing resources, sharing workshop information, and helping with administrative steps during the internship.

---

## 4. Relevance to My Academic Major
The internship topics were directly related to my academic major, but at a **deeper and more practical level** than university courses.  
I was able to learn and apply:

- AWS core services (VPC, EC2, IAM, RDS, S3, CloudFront)  
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform and CDK)  
- CI/CD pipeline (CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline)  
- Docker and container deployment with ECS/EKS  
- System observability with CloudWatch and X-Ray  

What I liked most was that the mentor explained **why** we do things in certain ways — focusing on trade-offs, scalability, and real architectural decisions.

## 5. Skills I Developed

### Technical Skills
- Designing AWS architecture using best practices  
- Building fully automated CI/CD pipelines  
- Applying IaC instead of manual configuration  
- Deploying microservices using containers  
- Setting up monitoring & alerting for production systems  

### Soft Skills
- Writing clear technical documentation  
- Communicating in a professional environment  
- Asking the right questions & critical thinking  
- Managing tasks and time effectively  
- Collaborating with the team in sprint cycles  

These skills helped me understand what it means to be a **Cloud Engineer** in real industry scenarios.

---

## 6. Team Culture and Collaboration
The FCJ program promotes a positive and collaborative culture: **respect, sharing, and growth**.  
Even as an intern, my suggestions and opinions were welcomed and discussed. This gave me confidence and helped me feel like a real member of the team.

When facing difficult tasks or urgent milestones, everyone supported each other — sharing solutions and best practices, which taught me how teamwork works inside a technical organization.

---

## 7. Policies and Benefits
The program provided an internship allowance and **flexible working hours**, which helped me balance learning and studying.  

What I valued most was the **learning opportunity**, including access to senior AWS architects and real workshops, such as:

- AI/ML/GenAI on AWS  
- DevOps on AWS  
- AWS Perimeter Protection  
- AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar  

These workshops expanded my knowledge beyond the internship scope and helped me build a broader understanding of cloud security, DevOps principles, and AI/ML solutions.

---

## 8. Summary Evaluation

### What I liked most
- Strong mentorship and clear learning direction  
- Practical and realistic tasks from real use cases  
- Positive working culture and peer support  
- Up-to-date training aligned with industry trends  

### Points I wish to add
- More internal sharing sessions on a weekly basis  
- More team-based mini projects to improve collaboration  
- Additional workshops on career development and interview skills  

### Recommendation
I **highly recommend** FCJ to students interested in Cloud and DevOps.  
The program does not only teach technologies, but it helps interns build the mindset of a **professional engineer**.

---

## 9. Suggestions and Expectations

### My Suggestions
- Organize small hackathons based on real cloud use cases  
- Provide a milestone tracking dashboard for each intern  
- Invite alumni to share their internship-to-career journey  

### My Expectations
After the internship, I hope to continue participating in more advanced phases of the program to further develop my skills.  
FCJ helped me confirm my career direction to become a **Cloud/DevOps Engineer** in the future.
